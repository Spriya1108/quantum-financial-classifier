Benchmarking Quantum QSVC vs Classical SVM on Financial Data.
# Quantum-Classical Hybrid Financial Classifier

## Project Overview
This project benchmarks the performance of a **Quantum Support Vector Classifier (QSVC)** against a classical SVM for detecting patterns in financial loan data. 

## Technology Stack
- **Quantum:** IBM Qiskit (Fidelity Quantum Kernels)
- **Classical:** Scikit-Learn (SVM), Pandas, NumPy
- **Environment:** Google Colab / Python 3.10

## Key Results
- Implemented a High-Dimensional Hilbert Space mapping using Quantum Kernels.
- Compared decision boundaries between Linear Classical Logic and Non-Linear Quantum Logic.
- **Result:** Achieved 70% accuracy with QSVC in a noise-simulated environment (Aer Simulator).
